All of this information is then organized by river or stream for later analysis. Users can then filter catches by specific conditions in preparation for their trip.",

This shop prides itself on emphasizing skateboarding as an art rather than a sport, viewing the activity as a creative interpretation of one’s surrounding landscape in a physical manner. Contemporary skate shops have taken the role as a community center and headquarters for local skateboarders; while maintaining the function of providing necessary products for skateboarding, shops also carry the responsibility of promoting the local skate scene. Concrete Canvas is an operation run purely for skateboarders by skateboarders. We intend to create unity in a scattered skateboarding scene by emphasizing key values in the community. The aesthetic of Concrete Canvas is based on the contrast between the vibrant and energetic appeal of skateboarding and the stony, urban environment that skateboarders thrive in. Finding the creative potential in overlooked or abandoned architectural structures is skateboarding’s highest calling, and this theme is presented outright in Concrete Canvas’s color scheme: radiating orange, yellow, and red emerging from fields of rigid gray.",
